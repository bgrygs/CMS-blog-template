Pilgrimage defines Sufi history in India. Lying at the heart of that history is Saint Mu’in al-Din Chishti and his tomb, the Ajmer Sharif. Starting in the 14th century, the Chishti masters extolled the virtues of pilgrimage to Sufi shrines, equating it to making Hajj–the Islamic tradition of pilgrimage to Mecca. After the death of Mu’in al-Din in 1236, his shrine quickly became a popular site of pilgrimage. Over the next six hundred years, scholars and Mughal rulers propagated the mythology of Mu’in al-Din and made pilgrimage to the Ajmer Sharif, contributing to its importance in the sacred landscape. Through popular usage, the rituals associated with these pilgrimages were slowly codified, creating a cohesive tradition of pilgrimage to Sufi shrines that emphasizes the intentions of the pilgrim within the sacred space.

The Chishti masters’ mandate to poverty made it difficult to make Hajj. Many of the Chishti masters, including Qutb ad-Din, Farid ad-Din, Nizam ad-Din, and Nasir ad-Din, all failed to make Hajj. They still valued the rites of pilgrimage, but they interpreted it as a personal journey of introspection in search of God, rather than a communal journey to the heart of Islam. As an alternative to the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Chishti masters lauded pilgrimage to the tombs of saints, claiming that this pilgrimage fulfilled the same spiritual requirement as Hajj. Thus, early Indian Sufis were more relaxed in their pilgrimage requirement than their counterparts elsewhere, and some opted instead to make pilgrimage to saints’ tombs, including that of Mu’in al-Din Chishti in Ajmer.

We can better understand the views of Sufis on pilgrimage by examining its related discourses. In the 14th century, for example, ‘Ala’ al-Dawla Simnani debated an “extreme idealist who scorned the spirit’s need for a body and so doubted the efficacy of pilgrimage to tombs.” In response, Simnani argued that the pilgrimage to tombs increased one’s spiritual concentration, as tombs are more connected with the spirit than any other space. Simnani further argued that proximity to the tomb allows the spirit to assist the pilgrim with their spiritual concentration; thus, the tombs are functional as a sacred space not because of any intrinsic spiritual value, but via the spiritual concentration of its visitors. This notion of assigned sanctity is important to keep in mind when discussing the mythology of Mu’in al-Din and the Ajmer Sharif.

In 1309, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Haqq Dihlavi published a biography of Mu’in al-Din Chishti, characterizing him as a very pious man with miraculous abilities. Dihlavi states that Mu’in al-Din was “head of the great Shaykhs and leaders of the Chishti order” in his region and that he constantly “busied himself with the worship of God,” thus establishing him as a religious authority. Dihlavi also describes a story in which Mu’in al-Din, having been mocked by the regional Hindu king Pithaura Rai, states: “We have caught Pithaura Rai alive, and delivered him (to his enemy).” Soon thereafter, Mu’in al-Din’s prophecy was made true–the region was invaded by Sultan Mu’izz ad-Din Sam, who captured Pithaura Rai and made Islam the prevailing religion in Ajmer. Dihlavi’s biography also includes numerous aphorisms attributed to the master which proclaim the virtues of self-reflection and the pursuit of knowledge. Thus, this biography enshrined Mu’in al-Din as a mythological figure for the Ajmer region.

The Mughal Empire placed great import on Ajmer Sharif, further integrating the dargah into the sacred landscape. The first Mughal Emperor to do so was Akbar the Great (r. 1556-1605), who, according to Abu’l Fazl–the emperor’s grand vizier–decided to make a pilgrimage to the Chishti shrine in 1562 after hearing songs praising Mu’in al-Din. Shortly after visiting the shrine, Akbar got married and had a son, both of which he attributed to the benevolent spirit of Mu’in al-Din. After Akbar’s successful siege at Chittor in 1568, he made another pilgrimage to the shrine, during which he donated a massive cauldron, which is still in use today. In addition, Akbar offered land grants for the maintenance of the dargah. These grants were continued by Akbar’s son Jahangir, and resulted in positions of volunteer service with ties to property and a substantial income, contributing to the dargah’s regional import.  In 1569, Akbar transferred the administration of the shrine to Shaikh Muhammad Bukhari, who improved the shrine’s lodgings and constructed the great mosque of Ajmer. Thus, through pilgrimage, donation, and appreciation, Akbar the Great contributed to the Ajmer Sharif’s establishment as an important Islamic site.

Princess Jahanara Begum, daughter of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, further contributed to the canonization of Mu’in al-Din by making pilgrimage to Ajmer and by composing an account of Mu’in al-Din’s life. Jahanara described herself using a feminine form of faqir–faqira–to indicate her vocation as a Sufi woman, and credited Mu’in al-Din–400 years after his death–with her initiation into Sufism. In The Confidant of Spirits, Jahanara describes her pilgrimage to the Ajmer Sharif in 1643, which she timed to coincide with Mu’in al-Din’s death anniversary. During her visit, she recited prayers and sections of the Quran, practices which are still carried out at Sufi shrines today. Jahanara’s account is notable not only for eliciting the role Sufi women–an underrepresented group in Sufi accounts, but also for further indicating the permeation of ritualistic pilgrimage to saints’ tombs into the royal Sufi class.

In the eighteenth century, Muhammad Najib Qadiri Nagawri Ajmeri wrote a treatise justifying and codifying the tradition of pilgrimage to saints’ tombs. In it, he defines the most important rituals of Sufi pilgrimage: determining the exact hour and day of death for commemoration, offering food and drink to the spirits, offering sweets, roses, flowers, or money at the tomb, and the performing of music on death anniversaries. In addition, Muhammad Najiv urges the pilgrims never to turn their back on the tomb, nor to turn their feet disrespectfully in that direction. He also states that pilgrims should act and dress appropriately when visiting the dargahs so as to not offend the saints, which he defines as being consciously present. These rituals and behaviors are still practiced today, indicating the efficacy of Muhammad Najib’s treatise in codifying Sufi pilgrimage tradition.

In the modern day, however, pilgrimage stands as a controversial practice. Modern Muslim reformers often consider pilgrimage to Sufi shrines to be the harmful result of the influence of Indian paganism, viewing it as idolatry. This view, however, overlooks the long history of pilgrimage in Islamic tradition, as discussed above, and misrepresents the nature of the practice. The Persian word for shrine, for example, is mazar, meaning a place that is visited. This term places priority on the pilgrim’s intentions and actions, not on the reliquary function of the visited site. This priority on the pilgrim’s intentions is also reflected in the varying religious identities of the pilgrims visiting the Ajmer Sharif today. That other religious groups attend the tomb is irrelevant–each individual assigns their own value to the space.
