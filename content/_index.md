Ajmer Sharif Dargah is the mausoleum of the Sufi Muslim saint Moinuddin Chishti, who helped promulgate the Chrishti Order in India. The dargah contains several other tombs, mostly of Moinuddin Chishti’s family. Prayers are enacted every day inside Mehfil Khana, a large reception room constructed in 1888. The Dargah has multiple gates, one of which is Jannati Darwaza, a silver gate upon which devotees tie a thread. When you tie a thread, you are supposed to make a wish, and vow to come back and untie it if your wish is fulfilled. The site is visited by people of many religions, including Hindus and Muslims, who offer chaddars and flowers to gain the saint’s blessing.

The dargah contains a degh (a large cauldron), from which it serves food to the needy, regardless of that person’s religious or ethnic background. The dargah also offers the namaz, the daily Muslim prayers. At sunset, the patrons sing qawwalis (Sufi Islamic devotional songs), after which they are asked to exit the dargah.

The dargah’s significance stems from its openness. Its stems from the the beliefs of Moinuddin Chishti, who practiced the love and acceptance encouraged by the Chishti Order. This tolerance is made evident by the Urs festival in Ajmer: very year, on the anniversary of Moinuddin Chishti’s death, the dargah holds a six-day celebration in which the dargah is open 24 hours a day to pilgrims of all faith. The festival Festival nights consist of singing, dancing, and the recitation of poetry or prayer. These festivities take place in the Mahfil Khana, and allow the admittance of women, which is an uncommon practice. The festival concludes with the recitation of religious poetry, followed by the Qul, a sacred chapter of the Quran.

The Ajmer Sharif Dargah is of interest of me due to its multiplicity and tolerance. I wanted to study an Islamic sacred site, because I was interested in how a minority community would organize their sacred spaces. I would have thought that, being a minority group, Muslims in India would want to protect their sacred spaces from the Hindu majority. I was surprised to find an inter-religious sacred space. I usually consider sacred spaces to be relatively restrictive, in that only members of a specific community will appreciate its importance. The idea that people of various religions appreciate and are welcome to Ajmer Sharif is an interesting concept to me. The dargah is also of interest to me as a site of celebration, being the location of the Urs festival. I think that, as a Catholic, I inherently consider sacred spaces to be places of reverence and tranquility. I have never experienced jubilant singing and dancing in a sacred space, and I would like more exposure to such practices.
