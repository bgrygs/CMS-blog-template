Temple of the Tooth



The Temple of the Tooth is a sacred temple located in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is believed that after The Buddha was cremated, his teeth were kept in a region in eastern India until a princess named Hemamali brough one of the Buddha’s teeth to Sri Lanka. The tooth is currently kept in a gold casket shaped like a stupa, which contains a series of six stupa caskets of diminishing size. The original temple in Kandy was destroyed by Portuguese invaders but the tooth was relocated and the current temple in Kandy was erected in the early 1700s. The temple today contains many architectural features that draw worshippers in addition to the obvious tooth artifact. The temple boasts beautiful red roofs with white textured walls situated next to a moat that are known as the wall of the water waves. At the entrance is an archway with two stone elephants. The interior offers similar white walls as well as the golden canopy on the ceiling which contains a pattern of expertly carved flowers made from valuable materials. Initially, I was drawn to the site because of its beautiful architecture - the expert craftsmanship of the building coupled with the thoughtful details struck my eye.

However, I also recognize the respect the temple demands and why this is such a key space to the Buddhist community. Buddhist artifacts are equal to the presence of Buddha himself. Therefore, the Temple of the Tooth is a modern day home to the Buddha- a feat which immediately beckons reverence and also political power. I was fascinated to learn about how such a small relic has been passed down over time which indicates not only the importance of the artifact itself, but also the strong history of Buddhism as a religion. The importance of the tooth relic is also manifested by the way political leaders interacted with it. Throughout the history of Sri Lanka, numerous leaders built temples for the tooth close to their homes. In fact,  it was declared that whoever houses and protects the relic is automatically given the power to rule the country. 

But the relic also is available to the common person in Sri Lanka which is an important part of its cultural power. Even to this day, the artifact serves as a significant symbol of Sinhalese identity and pride.  Each year, during the Esala Perahera procession, the relic casket is carried through the streets atop a male elephant. The 10-day festival is one of the largest Buddhist festivals in the world and the most significant in Sri Lanka. The tooth is also central to many different rituals that can either take place daily, weekly, or yearly. Specifically, every Wednesday the relic is washed with water, flowers, and herbs in an event known as the Nanumura Mangallaya. Today, two main monasteries have undertaken the responsibility of not only guarding but also providing proper worship to the tooth relic. Many thousands of worshippers visit the temple each day making it one of the most significant temples in Buddhism.
